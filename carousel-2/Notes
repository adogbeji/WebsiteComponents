Important Points:

NB: Unlike 'carousel-1', the indicators in this carousel are within the background image - looks nicer!

1) This contains code for building a Carousel Slideshow with CSS & JavaScript
2) Each carousel slide is hidden by default
3) The slideshow sections + controls should be put inside a wrapper div
4) Previous & next controls should be positioned relative to the parent wrapper div
5) Caption text should also be positioned relative to the parent wrapper div
6) You must apply the 'display: inline-block' rule to the indicators - or they won't show up!
7) The indicators should be put in their own div that is positioned relative to the parent wrapper div
8) NOTE: This carousel DOES NOT work with Bootstrap as the the framework CSS interferes with it!
